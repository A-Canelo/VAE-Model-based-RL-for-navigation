# VAE-Model-based-RL-for-navigation
Model-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm for navigation using VAE and DDPG.
This is a model-based RL algorithm using a VAE with an angular latent representation of the environment to perform a navigation task for autonomous vehicles.

The algorithm is inspired by model-based RL neuroscience experiments, where mice can pre-acquire a latent representation of a the map of a maze, that will accelerate the learning process when placed again in the maze. In our environment the vehcile should arrive at a target by reducing Euclidean distance and alignment with respect to the target.
